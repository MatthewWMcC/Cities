# Cities
This C program takes a file called cities.csv containing city names along with information about their population, location, country 
and other data points. A file called sorted.csv is produced containing the cities sorted by decreasing population size along with 
only their population number and country.

The example cities.csv that I worked with is included as well as the sorted.csv that was created upon running the program.
